  Text: Did you know that male penguins propose to their partners with a stone? During
    mating season, male penguins search for the perfect stone to offer their partner
    as a symbol of love and commitment. If the female accepts the stone, it means
    they are engaged and ready to start a family together. Penguins are just so romantic!
